### Option 4: Wait for GitHub Actions Recovery
Monitor [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) and use standard workflows when infrastructure is stable.

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

2. **Add Chrome Web Store credentials**
3. **Run**: `npm run release`

### For Development:
1. **Launch development version**: `npm run dev`
2. **Make changes** to src/ files
3. **Test in Chrome** with developer tools
4. **Use debugging commands** in console

## 🛠️ GitHub Actions Status

### Current Situation
- **Infrastructure Issue**: Widespread GitHub Actions problems
- **Action Downloads Failing**: actions/checkout, actions/setup-node, actions/cache
